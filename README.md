# Avocado
In this study, we will try to see if we can predict the Avocado’s Average Price based on different features. . The features are different (Total Bags,Date,Type,Year,Region…).

The variables of the dataset are the following:

1. Categorical: ‘region’,’type’
2. Date: ‘Date’
3. Numerical:‘Unamed: 0’,’Total Volume’, ‘4046’, ‘4225’, ‘4770’, ‘Total Bags’, ‘Small Bags’,’Large Bags’,’XLarge Bags’,’Year’
4. Target:‘AveragePrice’

Column Description: 

1. ‘Unamed: 0’ : Its just a useless index feature that will be removed in the notebook
2. ’Total Volume’ : Total sales volume of avocados
3. ‘4046’ : Total sales volume of Small/Medium Hass Avocado / Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
4. ‘4225’ : Total sales volume of Large Hass Avocado / Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold
5. ‘4770’ : Total sales volume of Extra Large Hass Avocado / Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold
6. ‘Total Bags’: Total number of Bags sold
7. ‘Small Bags’: Total number of Small Bags sold
8. ’Large Bags’: Total number of Large Bags sold
9. ‘XLarge Bags’: Total number of XLarge Bags sold
